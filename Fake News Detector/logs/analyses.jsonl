More than 300 South Koreans who were arrested in the raid have now been released from detention and are due to return home on Friday after having their release delayed by more than a day. Their departure was delayed because of an instruction from the White House, Lee added. President Donald Trump ordered the pause to check whether the workers were willing to remain in the US to continue working and training Americans, according to a South Korean foreign ministry official. Lee, who was speaking at a news conference to mark the first 100 days of his presidency, said \"the situation is extremely bewildering,\" while noting it is common practice for Korean firms to send workers to help set up overseas factories. \"If that's no longer allowed, establishing manufacturing facilities in the US will only become more difficult... making companies question whether it's worth doing at all,\" he added. Seoul is negotiating with Washington on visa options for South Korean workers \"whether that means securing [higher] quotas or creating new visa categories\", Lee said. \"I think the US will address this if they see it as a practical necessity.\" The BBC has contacted the White House for comment. Last week, US officials detained 475 people - more than 300 of them South Korean nationals - who they said were working illegally at the battery facility, one of the largest foreign investment projects in Georgia. LG Energy Solution, which operates the plant with Hyundai, said that many of its employees who were arrested had various types of visas or were under a visa waiver programme. A worker at the plant spoke to the BBC about the panic and confusion during the raid. The employee said the vast majority of the workers detained were mechanics installing production lines at the site, and were employed by a contractor. South Korea, a close US ally in Asia, has pledged to invest tens of billions of dollars in America, partly to offset tariffs. Media in the country have described the raid as a \"shock,\" with the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper warning that it could have \"a chilling effect on the activities of our businesses in the United States\". The Yonhap News Agency published an editorial on Thursday urging the two countries to \"cooperate to repair cracks in their alliance\". The timing of the raid, as the two governments engage in sensitive trade talks, has raised concern in Seoul. The White House has defended the operation at the Hyundai plant, dismissing concerns that the raid could deter foreign investment. On Sunday, US President Donald Trump referenced the raid in a social media post and called for foreign companies to hire Americans. The US government would make it \"quickly and legally possible\" for foreign firms to bring workers into the country if they respected its immigration laws, Trump said. The Korean car maker says many of the arrested workers now want to get back home They were originally expected to leave the US at about 14:30 local time (18:30 GMT) on Wednesday. Choi Mal-ja only managed to break free after biting off about 1.5cm of her alleged attacker's tongue. The president's pledge to restore jobs to American workers is running into conflict with other economic goals. Nearly 500 workers - most of them South Korean nationals - were seized in an immigration raid on a large Korean car plant in the US state of Georgia.","tokens":"south korean compani will hesit invest us follow massiv immigr raid hyundai plant state georgia last week presid lee jae myung 300 south korean arrest raid releas detent due return home fridai have releas delai dai departur delai instruct white hous lee ad presid donald trump order paus check whether worker will remain us continu work train american accord south korean foreign ministri offici lee speak new confer mark first 100 dai presid situat extrem bewild note common practic korean firm send worker help set oversea factori no longer allow establish manufactur facil us will becom difficult make compani question whether worth ad seoul negoti washington visa option south korean worker whether mean secur higher quota creat new visa categori lee think us will address practic necess bbc contact white hous comment last week us offici detain 475 peopl 300 south korean nation work illeg batteri facil on largest foreign invest project georgia lg energi solut oper plant hyundai employe arrest variou type visa visa waiver programm worker plant spoke bbc panic confus raid employe vast major worker detain mechan instal product line site emploi contractor south korea close us alli asia pledg invest ten billion dollar america partli offset tariff media countri describ raid shock dong ilbo newspap warn chill effect activ busi unit state yonhap new agenc publish editori thursdai urg two countri cooper repair crack allianc time raid two govern engag sensit trade talk rais concern seoul white hous defend oper hyundai plant dismiss concern raid deter foreign invest sundai us presid donald trump referenc raid social media post call foreign compani hire american us govern quickli legal possibl foreign firm bring worker countri respect immigr law trump korean car maker sai arrest worker want back home origin expect leav us 14 30 local time 18 30 gmt wednesdai choi mal ja manag break free bite off 5cm alleg attack tongu presid pledg restor job american worker run conflict econom goal nearli 500 worker south korean nation seiz immigr raid larg korean car plant us state georgia","predictedCategory":"real","scores":[{"label":"real","value":1.240248252701017e-261},{"label":"fake","value":1.2646435696561275e-288}],"sentiment":{"neg":0.061,"neu":0.891,"pos":0.048,"compound":-0.7902},"training":{"loadedFromCache":true}}}
