Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank.
Once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading.
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way.
Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end?
The rabbit took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket.
“Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” said the rabbit.
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage.
She found herself in a long hall with many locked doors.
A little glass table stood under a nearby window.
Alice saw a key on the table but it was too small to open any door.
She noticed a bottle on the table labeled “Drink me.”
After drinking, she began to shrink until she was very small.
Alice found a cake labeled “Eat me” and ate it.
She grew taller and taller until her head nearly touched the ceiling.
Alice saw a garden through a tiny door but could not enter.
She met a Cheshire Cat who could disappear and reappear.
The Mad Hatter and the March Hare invited Alice to a tea party.
They talked in riddles and sang strange songs.
Alice felt very confused but tried to enjoy the party.
Suddenly, Alice found herself in a courtroom.
The Queen of Hearts shouted “Off with her head!”
Alice stood up bravely and said the Queen was nothing but a pack of cards.
She woke up to find it was all a strange dream.

Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush.
He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit.
The fence was whitewashed, but not the way he wanted it.

Tom tricked his friends into doing the work for him.
He felt proud of his clever plan.

After the death of her parents, she was sent to live with her uncle in England.
